# Birthday-Paradox

Have you ever noticed how sometimes what seems logical turns out to be proved false with a little math? For instance, how many people do you think it would take to survey, on average, to find two people who share the same birthday? Due to probability, sometimes an event is more likely to occur than we believe it to. In this case, if you survey a random group of just 23 people there is actually about a 50â€“50 chance that two of them will have the same birthday. This is known as the birthday paradox. Don't believe it's true? Run the attached java code and test it yourself!
